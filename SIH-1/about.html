        <h2>Legislature</h2>
        <p>The Legislature is the body that creates and enacts laws in India. It is a bicameral system at the Union level, consisting of two houses: the <strong>Lok Sabha</strong> (House of the People) and the <strong>Rajya Sabha</strong> (Council of States). This system mirrors federalism by representing both the people and the states.</p>

          <p>The Legislature discusses and enacts laws for the governance of the country, ensuring that they reflect the will of the people. The Parliament also oversees the Executive's actions through debates, discussions, and question-answer sessions.</p>

        <h2>Executive</h2>
        <p>The Executive is responsible for implementing and enforcing the laws passed by the Legislature. It includes the President, the Prime Minister, and the Council of Ministers at the Union level, and the Governors and Chief Ministers at the state level.</p>

          <p>The Executive branch ensures that laws are properly executed. The President is the ceremonial head of the country, while the Prime Minister leads the day-to-day administration. The Executive ensures the efficient functioning of government departments and institutions.</p>

      <div class="body-info">
        <h2>Judiciary</h2>
        <p>The Judiciary interprets the Constitution and laws passed by the Legislature. It ensures justice is delivered in accordance with the laws and protects the fundamental rights of citizens. The Supreme Court of India is the apex court.</p>

        <div class="more-text hidden" id="judiciary-more">
          <p>The Judiciary is independent of the other two branches, and its role is crucial in ensuring that laws do not violate constitutional principles. It can strike down laws that are unconstitutional and provides checks on the powers of the Legislature and Executive.</p>
